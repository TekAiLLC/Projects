Backend low level tasks As discussed in meeting (10-04-2025):
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) Create sample Order entity and JPA, Service , controller layer
	Test it with H2 DB and postman
	Once it works, test it with Postgres DB.

2) Once this works, List the Use cases done by user
	What are the requests send by UI. ( UI team or desing needs to be known for this.)

3) based on step #2 result, we can create API's in Controllerr Layer.

4) We will also create Entitys, Repository and controller for data other than Order also.
